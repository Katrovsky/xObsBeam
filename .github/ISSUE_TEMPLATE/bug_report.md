**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Logs and details about your system**
Do a fresh start of both sender and receiver OBS, do what is necessary in one or both instances to provoke the bug, then exit both OBS instances. Start both OBS instances again, then from each of them upload a log through the OBS main menu like this:

![image](https://github.com/YorVeX/xObsBeam/assets/528974/85df41d7-6754-4132-9d65-f676f55e919c)

Then post the links to this log here.

Expect that it will be hard or even impossible to help with your issue without these logs. If, for some reason, you really are unable to provide them, at least this information is necessary that would otherwise have been contained in the logs:
 - OS and distro/version
 - OBS version
 - Beam version ("latest" is *not* a valid version, please specify the exact version number)
 - if you're using a network, how do you connect the computers involved, Ethernet (1G? 2.5? 5? 10?), or Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt Network?

**Additional context**
