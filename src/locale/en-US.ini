CompressionDensityText="Use lossless Density compression. Can be used on all color formats (including HDR) and will achieve a light bandwidth usage reduction at the lowest possible CPU usage cost."
CompressionDensityLevelCaption="Density compression level"
CompressionDensityStrengthCaption="Density compression strength"
CompressionDensityStrengthText="A higher strength means more CPU usage but also better compression and therefore a bandwidth usage reduction. 1 is the \"Chameleon\" algorithm, 2 the \"Cheetah\" algorithm and 3 the \"Lion\" algorithm. 2 is likely to have a CPU load impact similar to NDI and is the default."

CompressionMainThreadCaption="Compress from OBS render thread"
CompressionMainThreadText="Compress the image from the OBS render thread. This will generate less overhead but block the OBS render thread while compression is in progress. Recommended to leave enabled if possible, but disabled if compression is used and OBS reports skipped frames due to encoding lag or send queue warnings are shown in the OBS log."
CompressionFormatWarningText="Warning: The selected compression settings require a color conversion to {0}, which might have a negative performance/load impact. If your use case allows it you could try to change the global color format under: Settings -> Advanced -> Video -> Color format."
CompressionLevelText="Level 10 is the default and means compress all frames, 9 means compress 90% of frames, 8 compresses 80% of frames and so on, until at level 1 only 10% of frames are compressed."

ConnectionTypeCaption="Connection type"
ConnectionTypeText="The type of connection to use. Needs to be the same on sender and receiver side."
ConnectionTypePipeCaption="Named pipe (same machine connections)"
ConnectionTypePipeText="Use a named pipe for the connection. This has usually less overhead than a TCP socket connections when used within the same computer, select this if sender and receivers are on the same machine."
ConnectionTypeSocketCaption="TCP socket (remote machine connections)"
ConnectionTypeSocketText="Use a TCP socket for the connection. This has usually more overhead, select this if sender and at least one receiver are on different machines connected via network."

ReceiveAndRenderDelayCaption="Receive/Render delay"
ReceiveAndRenderDelayText="{0} ms / {1} ms"

RenderDelayLimitText="Force a reconnect when the render delay is higher than this limit. Set to 0 to disable."
RenderDelayLimitBelowFrameBufferTimeWarningText="Warning: The render delay includes the frame buffer time, hence this limit must be set higher or will lead to constant reconnections."
FrameBufferTimeCaption="Frame buffer time"
FrameBufferTimeText="The time to buffer frames for. Increasing this will reduce the chance of stuttering and A/V desync caused by short lags at the cost of increased latency."
FrameBufferTimeMemoryUsageInfoText="Note that buffering 60 frames (e.g. a buffer of 1000 ms for 60 fps) at 1080p will use roughly 500 MB of system memory."
FrameBufferTimeFixedRenderDelayCaption="Auto-adjust frame buffer for fixed render delay"
FrameBufferTimeFixedRenderDelayText="This will automatically adjust the size of the frame buffer to keep the render delay stable at the configured frame buffer time. Note that these adjustments can cause small video and audio glitches."
