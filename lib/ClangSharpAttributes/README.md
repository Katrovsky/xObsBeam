### What's this?
The ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator is always generating the same attribute classes, if more than one class is used that is generated by this then these would be duplicated.

To avoid this these classes were added only once here in the ClangSharp namespace and any generated files should be generated with a "using ClangSharp" statement to include these classes.
