EnableOutputCaption="Enable Beam output"
EnableOutputText="Enable or disable the Beam output. Note that you cannot access certain OBS settings while it is enabled."
IdentifierCaption="Identifier"
IdentifierText="The identifier of the sender. This is used to identify the sender in the receiver. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
NetworkInterfaceListCaption="Network interface"
NetworkInterfaceListText="List of currently available network interface, pick the one you want the sender to accept receiver connections on."
AutomaticListenPortCaption="Choose listen port automatically"
AutomaticListenPortText="Select this to have a listen port chosen automatically (recommended)."
ListenPortCaption="Listen port"
ListenPortText="The TCP port the sender will listen on for receiver connections. Should be between 1024 and 65535."
CompressionQOICaption="QOI compression"
CompressionQOIText="Use QOI image compression. This will reduce the bandwidth usage, but will also increase the CPU usage."
CompressionQOILevelCaption="Compression level"
CompressionQOILevelText="10 is the default and means compress 10/10 frames, 9 means compress 9/10 frames and so on."
CompressionQOINoBGRAWarningText="Warning: QOI compression is designed to work with BGRA color format only. Using it for other color formats still produces a working feed on the receiver but can lead to poor compression results. It is strongly recommended to change the color format to BGRA under Settings -> Advanced -> Video -> Color format."
CompressionThreadingCaption="Compression threading"
CompressionThreadingText="Compression threading options."
CompressionThreadingSyncCaption="Sync to OBS render thread"
CompressionThreadingSyncText="Sync the compression to the OBS render thread. This will generate less overhead but block the OBS render thread while compression is in progress."
CompressionThreadingThreadCountCaption="Thread count (0 = automatic)"
CompressionThreadingThreadCountText="The number of parallel threads to use for compression. When set to 0, the number of threads will be the number of available CPU cores."

ConnectionTypeCaption="Connection type"
ConnectionTypeText="The type of connection to use. Needs to be the same on sender and receiver side."
ConnectionTypePipeCaption="Named pipe (recommended)"
ConnectionTypePipeText="Use a named pipe for the connection. This has usually less overhead than a TCP socket connections."
ConnectionTypeSocketCaption="TCP socket"
ConnectionTypeSocketText="Use a TCP socket for the connection. This has usually more overhead, only use this if you have problems with the named pipe connection."

TargetPipeNameCaption="Beam sender pipe name"
TargetPipeNameText="The address of the sender's named pipe. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
TargetHostCaption="Beam sender host address"
TargetHostText="The address of the sender, can be an IPv4 address or a host name. Defaults to localhost if empty."
TargetPortCaption="Beam sender port"
TargetPortText="The port of the sender, should be between 1024 and 65535."
