EnableOutputCaption="Enable Beam output"
EnableOutputText="Enable or disable the Beam output. Note that you cannot access certain OBS settings while it is enabled."
IdentifierCaption="Identifier"
IdentifierText="The identifier of the sender. This is used to identify the sender in the receiver. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
NetworkInterfaceListCaption="Network interface"
NetworkInterfaceListText="List of currently available network interface, pick the one you want the sender to accept receiver connections on."
AutomaticListenPortCaption="Choose listen port automatically"
AutomaticListenPortText="Select this to have a listen port chosen automatically (recommended)."
ListenPortCaption="Listen port"
ListenPortText="The TCP port the sender will listen on for receiver connections. Should be between 1024 and 65535."
CompressionQOICaption="QOI compression"
CompressionQOIText="Use QOI image compression. This will reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the CPU usage, while retaining the original image quality."
CompressionQOILevelCaption="Compression level"
CompressionQOILevelText="10 is the default and means compress 10/10 frames, 9 means compress 9/10 frames and so on."
CompressionQOINoBGRAWarningText="Warning: QOI compression is designed to work with BGRA color format only. Using it for other color formats still produces a working feed on the receiver but can lead to poor compression results. It is strongly recommended to change the color format to BGRA under Settings -> Advanced -> Video -> Color format."
CompressionQOIMainThreadCaption="Compress from OBS render thread"
CompressionQOIMainThreadText="Compress the image from the OBS render thread. This will generate less overhead but block the OBS render thread while compression is in progress. Most users should leave this enabled, disabling will only give a benefit if OBS render time is becoming too high while other CPU cores still have capacity."

ConnectionTypeCaption="Connection type"
ConnectionTypeText="The type of connection to use. Needs to be the same on sender and receiver side."
ConnectionTypePipeCaption="Named pipe (same machine connections)"
ConnectionTypePipeText="Use a named pipe for the connection. This has usually less overhead than a TCP socket connections when used within the same computer, select this if sender and receivers are on the same machine."
ConnectionTypeSocketCaption="TCP socket (remote machine connections)"
ConnectionTypeSocketText="Use a TCP socket for the connection. This has usually more overhead, select this if sender and at least one receiver are on different machines connected via network."

TargetPipeNameCaption="Beam sender pipe name"
TargetPipeNameText="The address of the sender's named pipe. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
TargetHostCaption="Beam sender host address"
TargetHostText="The address of the sender, can be an IPv4 address or a host name. Defaults to localhost if empty."
TargetPortCaption="Beam sender port"
TargetPortText="The port of the sender, should be between 1024 and 65535."
