EnableOutputCaption="Enable Beam output"
EnableOutputText="Enable or disable the Beam output. Note that you cannot access certain OBS settings while it is enabled."
IdentifierCaption="Identifier"
IdentifierText="The identifier of the sender. This is used to identify the sender in the receiver. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
NetworkInterfaceListCaption="Network interface"
NetworkInterfaceListText="List of currently available network interface, pick the one you want the sender to accept receiver connections on."
AutomaticListenPortCaption="Choose listen port automatically"
AutomaticListenPortText="Select this to have a listen port chosen automatically (recommended)."
ListenPortCaption="Listen port"
ListenPortText="The TCP port the sender will listen on for receiver connections. Should be between 1024 and 65535."
CompressionCaption="Compression"
CompressionQOICaption="QOI compression"
CompressionQOIText="Use lossless QOI image compression. This will reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the CPU usage, while retaining the original image quality."
CompressionQOILevelCaption="QOI compression level"
CompressionJpegCaption="JPEG compression"
CompressionJpegText="Use JPEG image compression based on the libjpeg-turbo library. This will reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the CPU usage, while retaining the original image quality."
CompressionJpegLosslessCaption="Lossless JPEG compression"
CompressionJpegLosslessText="Use binary lossless JPEG image compression, meaning that the original image is retained exactly. This will use more bandwidth than the lossy JPEG compression."
CompressionJpegQualityCaption="JPEG compression quality"
CompressionJpegQualityText="The JPEG compression quality. Higher quality means less compression and more bandwidth usage, lower quality means more compression and less bandwidth usage. Note that even a value of 100 doesn't mean binary lossless."
CompressionJpegLevelCaption="JPEG compression level"
CompressionLevelText="Level 10 is the default and means compress all frames, 9 means compress 90% of frames, 8 compresses 80% of frames and so on, until at level 1 only 10% of frames are compressed."
CompressionLZ4Caption="LZ4 compression"
CompressionLZ4Text="Use lossless LZ4 image compression. If used standalone it can be used on all color formats and will will achieve a light bandwidth usage reduction at a relatively low CPU usage cost. If used in combination with QOI compression, this will compress the QOI compressed image and further reduce the bandwidth usage at the trade of more CPU usage."
CompressionLZ4SyncQoiSkipsCaption="Sync skips with QOI"
CompressionLZ4SyncQoiSkipsText="Don't apply LZ4 compression to frames that are skipped by QOI compression as controlled by the QOI compression level."
CompressionLZ4LevelCaption="LZ4 compression level"
CompressionLZ4LevelText="Read the description below for more information on each selected level."
CompressionLZ4LevelFASTInfoText="FAST compression algorithm flavor. Has low CPU usage but also low compression ratio. Very efficient to use this on top of QOI, this combo will be some kind of sweet spot for most users."
CompressionLZ4LevelHCInfoText="HC compression algorithm flavor. Has significantly higher CPU usage than FAST but also higher compression ratio. Only use this if you don't have enough bandwidth but enough CPU power."
CompressionLZ4LevelOPTInfoText="OPT compression algorithm flavor. Has significantly higher CPU usage than HC but also higher compression ratio. Not recommended for most users, especially not on top of QOI."
CompressionMainThreadCaption="Compress from OBS render thread"
CompressionMainThreadText="Compress the image from the OBS render thread. This will generate less overhead but block the OBS render thread while compression is in progress. Recommended to leave enabled if possible, but disabled if compression is used and OBS reports skipped frames due to encoding lag or send queue warnings are shown in the OBS log."
CompressionFormatWarningText="Warning: The selected compression settings require a color conversion to {0}, which might have a negative performance/load impact. If your use case allows it you could try to change the global color format under: Settings -> Advanced -> Video -> Color format."

ConnectionTypeCaption="Connection type"
ConnectionTypeText="The type of connection to use. Needs to be the same on sender and receiver side."
ConnectionTypePipeCaption="Named pipe (same machine connections)"
ConnectionTypePipeText="Use a named pipe for the connection. This has usually less overhead than a TCP socket connections when used within the same computer, select this if sender and receivers are on the same machine."
ConnectionTypeSocketCaption="TCP socket (remote machine connections)"
ConnectionTypeSocketText="Use a TCP socket for the connection. This has usually more overhead, select this if sender and at least one receiver are on different machines connected via network."

FrameBufferTimeCaption="Frame buffer time"
FrameBufferTimeText="The time to buffer frames for. Increasing this will reduce the chance of stuttering and A/V desync caused by short lags at the cost of increased latency."
FrameBufferTimeMemoryUsageInfoText="Note that buffering 60 frames (e.g. a buffer of 1000 ms for 60 fps) at 1080p will use roughly 500 MB of system memory."
TargetPipeNameCaption="Beam sender pipe name"
TargetPipeNameText="The address of the sender's named pipe. Defaults to \"BeamSender\" if empty."
TargetHostCaption="Beam sender host address"
TargetHostText="The address of the sender, can be an IPv4 address or a host name. Defaults to localhost if empty."
TargetPortCaption="Beam sender port"
TargetPortText="The port of the sender, should be between 1024 and 65535."
